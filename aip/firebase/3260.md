# Firebase CLI

## Guidance

### Project Selection

The Firebase CLI works with "project directories" that can be associated with
one or more Firebase projects via the `use` command. This ambient project
selection can be overridden by passing the `-P` or `--project` flag.

All Firebase CLI commands **must** determine the intended project for a command
based on common project selection, except when a command involves multiple
projects (e.g. a command that clones configuration from one project to
another).

### Arguments and Flags

All flags passed to the CLI **must** be optional. Required inputs for a command
should be kept to a minimum, and when necessary **must** be arguments.

Flags **must** be named using kebab case (e.g. `--example-flag`) and **may**
provide a single-letter alias that does not conflict with common global flags.

### Naming Commands

- Commands **must** use parameters for arguments.
- Commands **must** use a `:list` for listing multiple resources.

### Deployment

Behavior that takes local state (e.g. a rules file) and applies it to the live
operation of a Firebase project **must** integrate with the `deploy` command.
